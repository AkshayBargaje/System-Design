🔹 1. What is the Singleton Pattern?
The Singleton Pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

🔹 2. When to Use Singleton
Use it when:
Exactly one instance is required (e.g., configuration, logging, thread pool, cache, database connection).
The instance needs to be accessible globally.
Managing shared resources.

🔹 3. Core Characteristics
Feature	Description
Instance Control	Ensures a single instance exists
Global Access	Provides a well-known access point
Lazy Initialization	Often initialized on first use
Thread-Safety	Needs handling in multithreaded apps
Private Constructor	Prevents external instantiation
Static Method	Returns the same instance

🔹 4. Implementation (Languages)
🟦 Java Example (Thread-Safe Singleton)
java
public class Singleton {
    private static Singleton instance;
    private Singleton() {}
    public static synchronized Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new Singleton();
        }
        return instance;
    }
}

🟩 C++ Example
cpp
class Singleton {
private:
    static Singleton* instance;
    Singleton() {}
public:
    static Singleton* getInstance() {
        if (instance == nullptr) {
            instance = new Singleton();
        }
        return instance;
    }
};


🟥 Python Example
python
class Singleton:
    _instance = None

    def __new__(cls):
        if cls._instance is None:
            cls._instance = super().__new__(cls)
        return cls._instance
    
    
🔹 5. Variants of Singleton
Variant	Description
Lazy Initialization	Instance created when needed
Eager Initialization	Instance created at class load time
Thread-safe Singleton	Handles concurrent access
Double-checked Locking	Efficient thread-safe pattern
Bill Pugh Singleton (Java)	Uses static inner class for lazy loading

🔹 6. Pros
✅ Controlled access to sole instance
✅ Reduced memory footprint
✅ Useful for shared resources
✅ Centralized management

🔹 7. Cons
❌ Can introduce global state
❌ Makes unit testing harder
❌ Can violate SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)
❌ May lead to tight coupling

🔹 8. Best Practices
Use enum singleton in Java for serialization safety.
Avoid overusing it — it’s a global state.
Use dependency injection if testability is a concern.
Prefer lazy loading if startup cost is high.

🔹 9. Real-World Examples
Logger (single logging service across app)
Configuration Manager
Database Connection Pool
Thread Pool Manager
Cache Managers
Service Locator

🔹 10. Common Pitfalls
Not thread-safe in multi-threaded environments
Breaking singleton with serialization/deserialization
Allowing cloning or reflection to create new instances
Overusing it when stateless utility classes suffice

🔹 11. Testing Singleton
Use mocking frameworks
Avoid using direct Singleton calls in business logic
Inject Singleton instance using dependency injection for better testability

❌ How Singleton Violates SRP
In a pure object-oriented design, each class should:
Handle only its core business logic, and
Not be responsible for managing how it’s instantiated.
However, the Singleton class:
Does two things:
It implements business logic (e.g., logging, configuration, etc.).
It manages its own instance creation (enforcing one instance globally).
